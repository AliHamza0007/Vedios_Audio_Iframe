Certainly! Below is an example of how you can create an HTML page using `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<iframe>`, CSS media queries, and CSS variables. Additionally, I'll provide you with a README file template for GitHub.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/media-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd media-examples
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the media examples in action.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and media elements.
- `styles.css`: Defines styles for the HTML elements, including media queries and variables.`

In this example, the `index.html` file contains the HTML structure with `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<iframe>` elements. The `styles.css` file provides styles for these elements, including media queries for responsiveness and CSS variables for color customization.

The `README.md` file provides instructions on how to use the project, explains the file structure, and includes a license section. Remember to replace `your-username` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username. You can also customize the content further based on your needs.
